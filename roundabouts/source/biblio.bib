We find three levels of agreement with the empirical data: 1) models that do not reproduce even qualitatively the most important empirical observations, 2) models that are on a macroscopic level in reasonable agreement with the empirics, and 3) models that reproduce the empirical data on a microscopic level as well. Our results are not only relevant for applications, but also shed new light on the relevant interactions in traffic flow.",

@article{posstur,
	abstract = "We have developed a Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automata model for describing of vehicular traffic flow at a single intersection. A set of traffic lights operating in fixed-time scheme controls the traffic flow. Open boundary condition is applied to the streets each of which conduct a uni-directional flow. Streets are single-lane and cars can turn upon reaching to the intersection with prescribed probabilities. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to find the model flow characteristics. In particular, we investigate the flows dependence on the signalisation parameters, turning probabilities and input rates. It is shown that for each set of parameters, there exist a plateau region inside which the total outflow from the intersection remains almost constant. We also compute total waiting time of vehicles per cycle behind red lights for various control parameters.",

@article{tflr,
	abstract = "We construct a stochastic cellular automata model for the description of vehicular traffic at a roundabout designed at the intersection of two perpendicular streets. The vehicular traffic is controlled by a self-organized scheme in which traffic lights are absent. This controlling method incorporates a yield-at-entry strategy for the approaching vehicles to the circulating traffic flow in the roundabout. Vehicular dynamics is simulated within the framework of the probabilistic cellular automata and the delay experienced by the traffic at each individual street is evaluated for specified time intervals. We discuss the impact of the geometrical properties of the roundabout on the total delay. We compare our results with traffic-light signalisation schemes, and obtain the critical traffic volume over which the intersection is optimally controlled through traffic light signalisation schemes.",
